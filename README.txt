# Portfolio (Summer | 2016)
I began to develop an e-portfolio for myself with the goal of maintaining and sharpening my web development skills while also constructing a place where I can host all of my 
past, present, and future projects, college or otherwise. It also serves as a platform for evaluation when linked with my CV in lieu of having no IT experience in the industry. It is constantly subject to 
change and is something I will continually develop and redevelop as needed. It is currently hosted here: www.seanbickmore.com
